# Arrest Prediction Using Machine Learning on Chicago Crime Data

**Project Objective**

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of an arrest based on various features from crime data provided by the City of Chicago. 
The model aims to assist in understanding crime patterns and improving decision-making in public safety analytics.

Time Range: 2019â€“2024

**Model Development**

Multiple machine learning algorithms were explored, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Each model was trained and evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. 

**Result**

After thorough experimentation, the Random Forest model emerged as the top performer, achieving the highest accuracy of 90.8% on the test set.
